Hello and welcome! My name is Jaehyung, and I graduated from the University of Southern California with a B.S. in Quantitative Biology, minor in Computer Science, and a M.S. in Computer Science. I'm a software engineer at Flexport, and enjoy a variety of nature-related activities, primarily hiking and camping. Thanks for visiting, and hope you have a nice day!
Fight On!
